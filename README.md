In recent years, the demand for secure image communication over public networkshas increased significantly. To address this 
demand, this project presents a novel approach to image encryption and decryption using chaotic and DNA algorithms. 
The proposed method leverages the chaotic properties of chaotic maps to generate pseudo-random sequences for encryption, 
while DNA encoding techniques are employed to enhance the security and robustness of theencryption process. In the 
encryption phase, the original image is transformed into a chaotic domain using a chaotic map, and then further encrypted 
using DNA-based techniques. The decryption process involves the reverse transformation, where the encrypted image is 
decoded using the same DNA encoding scheme and chaotic map to retrieve the original image.Experimental results 
demonstrate the effectiveness and security of the proposed method against various cryptographic attacks, 
including statistical analysis and brute-force attacks. Furthermore, the method exhibits high computationalefficiency, 
makingit suitable for real-time image encryption applications. Overall, the proposedapproach offers a promising solution 
for secure image communication in applications requiring high levels of confidentiality and integrity. Future research
directionsmay include exploring optimization techniques to further enhance the performance and scalability of the proposed method.
This abstract provides a brief overview of the model's objectives, methodology, results, and potential implications, serving as a concise 
summary for readers.
